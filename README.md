# DarKnight: A 2D Platformer for Investigating Camera Movement Influence on Player Performance

## About

This repository contains the Unreal Engine 5.3 project for a 2D side-scroller game developed as part of a research study. The game, named DarKnight, was created to investigate the impact of camera movement on player performance and experience.

The core of the research question was:

> Does the direction of camera movement and game flow - whether progressing from left-to-right or right-to-left - significantly affect player performance, behavior, and perceived difficulty in a 2D platformer?

## Key Features

*   **Two Playtest Modes:** The game features two distinct playtest modes, each with a different camera orientation (left-to-right and right-to-left). 
*   **Multiple Characters:** Players can choose from a selection of characters, each with unique abilities, adding depth to the gameplay. 
*   **Varied Levels:** The game includes multiple levels with varying difficulty, providing a range of challenges for players. 

## Research Outcomes

The study found no statistically significant correlation between camera direction and player performance metrics, suggesting that camera orientation does not substantially affect gameplay outcomes in a 2D side-scroller.
